# Auto Layout Calculator

  1. open up Open-Me
  2. We have the basics of a calculator set up.
  3. The bottom Buttons should take up the bottom half of the screen. They
     should be equally gridded in the bottom half. **hint: You can make the
     buttons bigger without them looking bigger...**
  4. The top uitextfield should be flush against the top layout guide
  5. The top uitextfield should be as wide as the screen.
  6. Make this work in both Landscape and Portrait

## Extra Credit

  1. Add another column of operators (*,/,+,-)
  2. Make the calculator work! It's actually a bit less straight forward then
     you think.
